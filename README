vala-benchmarks
A collections of some simples benchmarks written in Vala. 

This project aims to implement [http://shootout.alioth.debian.org "The 
Computer Language Benchmarks Game"] in Vala.

Vala is a new programming language that aims to bring modern programming 
language features to GNOME developers without imposing any additional 
runtime requirements and without using a different ABI compared to 
applications and libraries written in C. The syntax of Vala is similar 
to C#, modified to better fit the GObject type system.

From Vala FAQ:

    How does the performance of Vala applications compare to other 
applications?

    The performance should be pretty similar to GObject/C-based code as 
there is no Vala-specific runtime library/environment that needs to be 
loaded. The C compiler can also apply the same optimizations on 
Vala-generated C code and plain GObject/C code. The Vala compiler uses 
reference counting in more places than most GObject/C-based applications 
do. However, Vala allows to fine-tune that easily in 
performance-critical sections with the weak modifier.
