# Describe how to help the project

= Organization =

This wiki use one page per benchmark. The name is the same as in [http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/gp4/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=gcc&lang2=gpp shootout page] except that we transform `foo-bar` in `fooBar`.


= Discussion =

To discuss an implementation of a bench, use the comment. There is at this time no Mailing List to discuss. Use the Vala charoom [irc://irc.gimp.org/#vala] if you want.

= For Developers =
