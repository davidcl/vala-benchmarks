#summary What is the compiler optimizations turned ON

= Introduction =

This document describe what is the GCC and Mono:Runtime options used in this benchmark. For Mono:Runtime, we use the Ahead-of-Time compiler which make the comparison more precise (as the JIT add some overhead).

We try to use the same optimizations in all the programs but it's fairly difficult, please discuss the options on the Comment Section.


= GCC options =

First of all, all the plain-C sources or not exactly like on the [http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/ "The Computer Language Benchmarks Game"]. We prefer using standard C code and not especially SSE2-SSE3 hardcoded instructions, the compiler *must* do the optimizations.

As explain above, GCC must do *all the optimizations*. For more informations, read these links :
  * [http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/tree-ssa/vectorization.html Auto-vectorization in GCC]
  * [http://www.network-theory.co.uk/docs/gccintro/gccintro_49.html An Introduction to GCC - 6.4 Optimization levels]
  * [http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html Using the Gnu Compiler Collection - 3.10 Options That Control Optimization]

So we use a command line like :
{{{
   gcc -O3 -funroll-loops -ftree-vectorize -fvect-cost-model -ftracer program.c -o program
}}}



= Mono options =

As written on [http://www.mono-project.com/CSharp_Compiler#CIL_Optimizations. the Mono website], the C# compiler doesn't make any advanced optimizations, it try to conserve a generic CLI code.

The Mono:Runtime (CLI) make the optimizations especially in the [http://www.mono-project.com/Mono:Runtime#Ahead-of-time_compilation Ahead-of-Time] mode. 

So we use a command line like:
   * Compilation : {{{ mcs program.cs }}}
   * Mono:Runtime : {{{ mono -O=all --aot program.exe }}}
